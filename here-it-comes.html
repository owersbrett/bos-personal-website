                        Brett Owers (“we” or “us” or “our”) respects the privacy of his users (“user” or “you”). 
                        <br> 
                        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our mobile application (the “Application”).   
                        <br> 
                        Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.  
                        <br> 
                        IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS THE APPLICATION. 
                        <br> 
                        This privacy policy was autogenerated. 
                        <br> 
                        At the time this policy was generated, no data was being collected by me.
                        <br> 
                        In future updates, this reality may change. The following auto generated privacy policy is a requirement for me to get on the app store, even without collecting data.
                        <br> 

                        We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason.  We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of this Privacy Policy.  You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. 
                        
                        You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the Application after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.  
                        
                        This Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party online/mobile store from which you install the Application or make payments, including any in-game virtual items, which may also collect and use data about you.  We are not responsible for any of the data collected by any such third party. 
                        
                        COLLECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION

                        Currently in app there is no method of collecting information from the user.
                        
                        Emails and Communications
                        If you no longer wish to receive correspondence, emails, or other communications from us, you may opt-out by:
                        Noting your preferences at the time you register your account with the Application
                        Logging into your account settings and updating your preferences.
                        Contacting us using the contact information provided below
                        If you no longer wish to receive correspondence, emails, or other communications from third parties, you are responsible for contacting the third party directly. 
                        CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
                        California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.
                        
                        If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Application, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Application. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California.  We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Application, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems.
